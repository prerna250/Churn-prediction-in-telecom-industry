Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry Using Logistic Regression

In this project, I developed a churn prediction model for the telecom industry using logistic regression. The primary objective was to identify customers who are likely to churn and gain insights into the factors contributing to churn. After preprocessing the dataset, I visualized the distribution of churn using a pie chart, revealing that approximately 14.5% of customers were likely to churn. Additionally, I calculated and visualized the confusion matrix and ROC curve to evaluate the model's performance. The logistic regression model accurately predicted whether customers were likely to churn or not. Through this project, I obtained valuable insights that can aid the telecom company in implementing targeted retention strategies and reducing customer churn.
